      Iâ€™m Meghna, a passionate product-minded Web Developer, who adores a good design and loves developing one even moreâœ¨âœ¨

I'm currently working towards my Master's degree majoring in Information Systems from Northeastern University, Boston.

Previously, I spent 1.5 years at Mindtree Limited (now LTIMindtree), developing solutions for Fortune 500 clients on the Salesforce platform.
Here, I've worked with different cross-functional teams in an agile environment and contributed to all stages in the software development lifecycle.

I'm always learning new things, currently getting my hands dirty in learning and exploring Cloud (Terraform) and GraphQL. 
I am eager to apply my growing knowledge as a full stack developer within an engaging and collaborative environment.

In my free time, I enjoy creating side projects, reading books, visiting museums, cooking, trying out new coffee, and occasionally hitting the gym. ðŸ˜œ
